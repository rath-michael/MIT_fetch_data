# Fetch Data Assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to get used to working with API's in React and JSX, using either fetch() or axios(). THe project has gone through several rounds of refactoring to get to the point its at now.

This assignment meets the criteria needs for completion, but I have some plans for things to make it better in the future, including optimizing the code and some obviously needed visual changes.
